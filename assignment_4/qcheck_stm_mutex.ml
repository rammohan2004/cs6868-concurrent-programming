(** QCheck-STM sequential state-machine test for the fiber-level Mutex.

    Tests the non-blocking operations ([try_lock], [unlock]) against a
    simple boolean model (state = "is the mutex currently locked?").
    Only sequential mode is used — concurrent mode would require
    multiple Domains, which conflict with the unicore fiber scheduler.
