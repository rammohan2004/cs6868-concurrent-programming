(** CML-style events for composable synchronous communication.

    Any synchronisation primitive (channels, IVars, …) can create events.
    {!select} waits for the first of several events to occur.

    A single shared {!Trigger.t} is used across all cases: the first
    counterpart to signal it wins; others see {!Trigger.signal} return
    [false] and skip the stale waiter. *)
