(** A bounded channel with Go-like semantics and CML-style event support.

    {b Invariants}:

    - [0 <= Queue.length buf <= capacity].
    - For plain [send]/[recv] (outside select), [receivers] has live
      entries only when [buf] is empty, and [senders] has live entries
      only when [buf] is full.
    - When [select] is used, both [receivers] and [senders] may
      contain live entries on the {i same} channel (e.g. a select
      offering both [recv_evt ch] and [send_evt ch v]).  Stale entries
      from lost select races are harmlessly skipped by
      {!find_live_receiver} / {!find_live_sender}.
    - Each trigger is signaled at most once.  Stale entries may linger
      in the queues and are harmlessly skipped. *)
