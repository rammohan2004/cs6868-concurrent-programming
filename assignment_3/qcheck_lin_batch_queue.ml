(** QCheck-Lin Linearizability Test for Batch Bounded Blocking Queue

    This test verifies that the non-blocking try_enq/try_deq operations
    are linearizable under concurrent access.

    == Your Task ==

    Complete the BatchQueueSig module below:
    1. Define wrapper functions for batch operations with fixed sizes
    2. Define the [api] list using Lin's DSL ([val_] combinator)

    == Design Note ==

    try_enq takes an int array argument and try_deq returns int array option.
    The Lin DSL works best with primitive types, so we define wrapper functions
    for small fixed batch sizes (1, 2, 3) and register each as a separate
    operation. This tests the core batch logic with manageable complexity.

    == Expected Result ==

    This test should PASS. The mutex-based implementation ensures all
    operations are linearizable.
